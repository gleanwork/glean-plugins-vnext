# Glean Claude plugin

Glean's plugin for [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview)
and [Claude Cowork](https://claude.com/cowork). This repo is a single-plugin
marketplace.

Today it ships one plugin:

- **`glean-vnext`** — adds two static tools, `find_skills` and `run_tool`, that
  let the agent discover Glean-hosted skills for enterprise apps (Jira, Slack,
  Google Workspace, Salesforce, etc.) and invoke their downstream tools via
  Glean's MCP gateway. Once the user has authenticated, the plugin also
  surfaces a small allow-list of Glean's first-class tools — currently
  `search` and `read_document` — directly, with schemas pulled from the
  remote MCP server.

## Install

### Claude Code (terminal)

```
/plugin marketplace add gleanwork/glean-experimental-plugins
/plugin install glean-vnext@glean-experimental-plugins
```

### Claude Cowork (desktop)

1. Open the plugin picker.
2. Click **Add marketplace**, choose **GitHub**, and enter
   `gleanwork/glean-experimental-plugins`.
3. Once the marketplace syncs, install the **glean-vnext** plugin from it.

## First run

The first tool call triggers OAuth sign-in to Glean via the `setup` tool.
The agent's skill walks the user through the sign-in URL and paste-back
flow. After sign-in, OAuth credentials are cached to `~/.glean/` and reused
across sessions — you won't be prompted again until the refresh token
expires.

## Updates

```
# Claude Code
/plugin marketplace update glean-experimental-plugins

# Cowork: the plugin picker has a "Sync" / "Check for updates"
# button on the marketplace entry.
```

## Testing a specific branch or PR

You can point the marketplace at a specific git branch, tag, or commit:

```bash
# Install from a specific branch (e.g. a PR branch)
/plugin marketplace add gleanwork/glean-experimental-plugins@branch-name
/plugin install glean-vnext@glean-experimental-plugins

# Or update an existing marketplace to a different branch
/plugin marketplace remove glean-experimental-plugins
/plugin marketplace add gleanwork/glean-experimental-plugins@branch-name
```

You can also pin to a branch in `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "marketplaces": [
    {
      "name": "glean-experimental-plugins",
      "source": "https://github.com/gleanwork/glean-experimental-plugins",
      "sourceType": "git",
      "branch": "mohit-baseline-marketplace-layout"
    }
  ]
}
```

For local development, point the marketplace at your local checkout instead:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/glean-experimental-plugins
```

Then just `git checkout` whichever branch you want to test.

## Troubleshooting

- **Sign-in loop** — the cached OAuth provider state may be stale. Delete
  `~/.glean/mcp-credentials.json` and retry.
- **`GLEAN_MCP_SERVER_URL is required`** — the plugin's `.mcp.json` wasn't
  picked up by the host. Reinstall; if that fails, open an issue.

## Development

Prerequisites: Node 22+, npm.

```bash
npm install
npm test            # vitest
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
npm run build       # esbuild → plugins/glean/dist/index.js
```

Source is at the repo root (`src/`, `tests/`, `scripts/`). Packaged
runtime lives under `plugins/glean/`. See the Layout section below.

## Release process

1. Bump `version` in `plugins/glean/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.
2. `npm test && npm run typecheck` — verify clean.
3. Commit, tag, and push:
   ```bash
   git tag v<version>
   git push && git push --tags
   ```
4. Draft a release on GitHub.
