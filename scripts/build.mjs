// Build the plugin's MCP server into a single-file ESM bundle.
//
// Why bundle: Cowork's plugin-install validator rejects zip entries whose
// paths contain `@`, which appears in every scoped npm package's directory
// name (`node_modules/@modelcontextprotocol/...`). Inlining every dep into
// one `dist/index.js` means the shipped tree has no scoped-package paths.
//
// Bundle shape:
//   - platform=node, format=esm so Node can load it with `node dist/index.js`
//     and no `--experimental-*` flags, matching our package.json type:module
//   - bundle=true with packages='bundled' so every import except Node
//     builtins gets inlined
//   - external: the `node:*` builtins (explicit for clarity; esbuild on
//     platform=node treats bare `node:*` as external by default but we pin
//     it so this doesn't regress silently)
//   - no sourcemap or minification — the bundle is checked into git and
//     should stay readable for debugging
